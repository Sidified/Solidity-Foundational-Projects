# My First 5 Solidity Projects: A Beginner's Guide üöÄ
*From first-draft code to professionally refactored solutions*



Hello and welcome! You're at the beginning of an exciting journey into the world of blockchain and smart contract development. This guide was created to be the perfect first step for absolute beginners.

## A Note from a Fellow Beginner ‚úçÔ∏è

My name is **Sid**, and if you're reading this, you're probably in the exact same place I am: excited about blockchain, eager to learn Solidity, but not sure where to start. As a complete beginner to both coding and this technology, my own journey was kickstarted by the fantastic, free educational resources provided by Patrick Collins. A huge thank you to him for making this knowledge so accessible.

After following his course, I knew that before moving on to more advanced topics, I needed to truly grasp the fundamentals. I believe **the best way to learn is by doing**‚Äîby building, making mistakes, and learning from them. For that reason, I created these five projects for my own practice to solidify my understanding.

This guide is the result of that journey. It's my hope that by sharing my process, including my initial mistakes and the helpful guidance I received from an AI learning partner (Gemini), I can provide a useful resource for anyone else who wants to practice the fundamentals of Solidity.

Inside, you'll find the five projects that took me from knowing nothing to building a fully functional smart contract factory. For each project, I‚Äôve included:

* **My initial, unrefined code**‚Äîmy honest first attempt at solving the problem.
* **Detailed feedback and improvements** that I developed with the help of an AI learning partner.
* **A final, professionally refactored version** of the code that is cleaner, safer, and more gas-efficient.

This is an open-source guide made by a beginner, for beginners. I created it to share the exact path I took, hoping it can help you solidify your own understanding.

## How to Use This Guide for the Best Results üéØ

This guide is designed for you to follow the same path of learning by doing. To get the most out of it, I highly recommend following these steps for each of the five projects:

1.  **Read the Objective Only**
    Start each project by reading only the **Objective**. Avoid looking at my code. Your first goal is to understand the problem you need to solve.

2.  **Try to Build It Yourself (This is the most important step!)**
    Open up the Remix IDE and try to write the smart contract from scratch. It‚Äôs okay if it‚Äôs messy or if you get stuck. The process of struggling and searching for a solution is where the real learning happens.

3.  **Compare Your Code with My First Attempt**
    Once you have a version that works, compare it to my initial code. It‚Äôs valuable to see how another beginner approached the same problem.

4.  **Review the Professional Refinements**
    Read the improvements section. This is where you'll learn the difference between code that simply "works" and code that is **secure, efficient, and professional**.

5.  **See the Final Refined Code**
    Finally, read the complete, refactored code that implements all the suggested improvements.

By following this process, you‚Äôll be training yourself to think like a real smart contract developer. Let's get started!

## The 5 Solidity Projects üèóÔ∏è

### [Project 1 (Very Easy): Simple On-Chain Diary](./01-On-Chain-Diary/)
> **Objective:** Create a smart contract where a single user (the owner) can store and retrieve a short text entry.



### [Project 2 (Easy): Simple Event Tickets](./02-Event-Tickets/)
> **Objective:** Create a smart contract that sells a limited number of tickets for an event at a fixed price. Each user can only buy one ticket, and the contract owner can withdraw the money collected.

### [Project 3 (Medium): Simple Voting System](./03-Simple-Voting/)
> **Objective:** Create a smart contract to manage a vote on a single proposal. The owner can add a list of approved voters, start and stop the voting period, and each approved address can only vote once.

### [Project 4 (Hard): Simple Escrow Contract](./04-Simple-Escrow/)
> **Objective:** Build a digital middleman (an escrow) to hold money safely during a deal. A Buyer deposits money, and a trusted Judge decides whether to release the money to the Seller or refund it to the Buyer.

### [Project 5 (Very Hard): Voting Contract Factory](./05-Simple-Vending/)
> **Objective:** Build a "Vending Machine for Voting Polls." This main contract (the Factory) allows anyone to pay a fee to create their own new, separate Voting contract. The factory also keeps a public list of all the voting contracts it has created.
